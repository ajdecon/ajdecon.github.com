<p>I'm not much of a letter writer... but I encourage everyone to write <br />their own reps about this one. <p /> Dear Mr. Johnson, <p /> It has been revealed in open court that the National Security Agency <br />and AT&amp;T have installed a fiber-optic splitter at the AT&amp;T facility in <br />San Francisco. &nbsp;This splitter provides copies of all emails, web <br />browsing, and other Internet traffic which pass over AT&amp;T's network to <br />the NSA. &nbsp;(U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, Class <br />Action Case No. C-06-0672-VRW; Tash Hepting, Gregory Hicks, Carolyn <br />Jewel, and Erik Knutzen On Behalf of Themselves and All Others <br />Similarly Situated vs AT&amp;T. <br /><a href="http://www.eff.org/legal/cases/att/SER_marcus_decl.pdf)">http://www.eff.org/legal/cases/att/SER_marcus_decl.pdf)</a> <p /> The existence of such a device is in itself egregious. &nbsp;The usage of <br />this device to copy all traffic is an unprecedented intrusion into the <br />private communications of American citizens. &nbsp;Not only is this <br />surveillance not authorized by any warrant, it is carried out in such <br />a manner that the vast majority of the people whose communications are <br />tapped must be innocent of any crime. &nbsp;Even if it were likely that <br />terrorists were among AT&amp;T's subscribers--and it is not--this kind of <br />wholesale, bulk surveillance is both unnecessary and ridiculous. <p /> Nor is this only a matter for AT&amp;T's customers. &nbsp;By the nature of the <br />Internet, almost everyone's traffic will pass through their network at <br />one time or another--even even that one hub in San Francisco. <p /> As a Republican, I am sure that you are sympathetic to the idea that <br />government powers may be abused. &nbsp;Even if this capability were <br />guaranteed to be used only for defense, I would be suspicious; but <br />neither this Administration nor any likely future one can be trusted <br />to hold such sweeping surveillance powers without abuse. &nbsp;The idea of <br />wielding the powers of the NSA for political purposes is terrifying. <p /> As an American citizen, I hope that the Congress of the United States <br />will take action to correct this action and punish those responsible. <br />As a resident of your district, I have a right to know what your views <br />on this issue are, and what action you will take. <p /> I look forward to your reply. <p /> Sincerely, <br />Adam DeConinck</p>
