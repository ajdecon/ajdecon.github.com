<p>But for now, there are just so many interesting things to play with!</p>
<p>Ignoring my list of real useful todos for work and life (ha!), I still have way too many personal projects which I can't bring myself to abandon...</p>
<ul>
<li>Train myself back up to decent epee fencing</li>
<li>Work my way through a decent book on MPI programming</li>
<li>Finish that book on machine learning I've been working on since last year</li>
<li>Learn enough practical computer security to be dangerous</li>
<li>Work my way through the Ruby on Rails tutorial</li>
<li>Find people to build a jazz combo with</li>
<li>Build a 3D printer</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>The list really doesn't end. &nbsp;If I added it all up, won the lottery and quit my job, I'm still not sure I could manage it. &nbsp;And my job is at least as interesting as most of the things on my fun list!</p>
<p>On the plus side: when I was still in grad school, I was too beaten down to even think about doing most of these things. &nbsp;The new job has really made almost everything better: more fun, more money, more self-esteem, more motivation, and more smiles for Leigh and the cats.</p>
<p>Now if only I had more free time...</p>
