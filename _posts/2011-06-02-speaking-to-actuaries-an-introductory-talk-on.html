<p>In May 2011 I gave an talk at the Society of Actuaries Life &amp; Annuity Symposium, as a part of the High Performance Computing panel. At R Systems I've worked with a variety of types of customers, including some actuaries: insurance companies have to model many different possible scenarios for their policies, and this can be extremely computationally intensive. &nbsp;(I actually quite like these customers: a lot of the actuaries I've worked with have very technically-oriented mindsets, perhaps unsurprisingly, and a good appreciation of both the technology and mathematics involved in their work.) &nbsp;So when the conference organizers invited us to contribute a talk, off I went to New Orleans!</p>
<p>My part of the panel was an introductory talk on HPC combined with a basic case study.  It was pitched to the actuarial audience, but I think it's a nice introduction to a lot of HPC concepts in general.  It's available publicly at the <a href="http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/2011-new-orleans-las-43.pdf">SOA web site</a>, but I wanted nicer formatting so I uploaded to SlideShare.  Enjoy!</p>
