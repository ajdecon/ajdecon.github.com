 title="It's so true!" />

When I was a kid, I was absolutely convinced I was going to be an
academic physicist when I grew up. 

This conviction probably had to do with both my natural interests, 
which were heavily oriented towards math and science, but oriented away from
anything "gooey" (ruling out biology); and with my entertainment preferences, which 
involved a lot of hard science fiction in space, where physics shines and many of
the heroes were physicists. I was also young and naive enough to believe
that academia was like some kind of knowledge-producing utopia, which made
it much more appealing than the seemingly business-oriented world of
computing.

(My parents get a lot of credit as well...
not necessarily for pushing physics in particular, but for being 
science-positive people in technical fields, 
unfailingly supportive of their geeky son and
also the sorts of people who watch <em>Star Trek</em> and 
<em>Babylon 5</em> with their kids.)

Things, of course, did not turn out as I predicted: while my undergrad
experience as a Physics major was pretty close to perfect, 
grad school (in materials science) shattered my 
perception of academic science, and put me through several different kinds of
hell due to problems with my thesis project. After grad school I ended up
in high-performance computing doing cluster administration and systems
engineering. It's a ridiculous amount of fun and I'm very happy, 
but it seems pretty distant
from those dreams of doing physics in academia.

Despite this, I'm still


1. Problem solving and reasoning skills
1. Exposure to a broad(ish) range of math
1. Appreciation for other fields
1. Experimentation, data, and computation
1. Closest thing to a "liberal arts" science degree
