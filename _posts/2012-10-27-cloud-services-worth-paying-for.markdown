Despite being generally suspicious of any branding relating to "the cloud", I actually do use
a variety of Internet-based services to accomplish many of my computing tasks. Even more than
that, I pay for many of them!

Here's a list of cloud services I find valuable enough to actually spend money on them. This
entry will likely get updated as I find new services and/or remember any of them 
that I've forgotten.

### File storage stuff ###

* [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/): A service for syncing files between different computers
and devices transparently, through the concept of a single shared folder. It really does
"just work". While there's a 2 GB free tier, I pay for the 100 GB tier because I never like throwing
anything away.

* [Tarsnap](http://www.tarsnap.com/): "Online backups for the truly paranoid", Tarsnap 
performs encrypted backups to Amazon's Simple Storage Service using extremely-strong, 
well-vetted and open-source encryption software. Fairly cheap, it's priced at 
"300 picodollars/byte-month" ($0.30/GB-month) after compression and deduplication.
This is my off-site backup solution for my personal machine and random servers (on-site is
an Apple Time Capsule, which is also incredibly convenient).

### Entertainment ###

These ones are typically shared with my wife, Leigh.

* [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/): Basically, auto-generated Internet radio stations.
I pay for the "Pandora One" service to skip the ads, and it's one of the best uses of $36/year
I can think of. Maybe I'm lazy, but when I'm at work or concentrating on other things I'd rather
not have to build a playlist, and I like getting new music. Pandora handles it for me.

* [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/): A huge archive of movies and TV shows, available 
all the time on most devices, for a low monthly fee? What's not to like?

* [Amazon Instant Video, Cloud Player, and Kindle](http://www.amazon.com): It doesn't
*quite* qualify as a cloud service in my mind, because you have to buy specific items;
but Amazon does make it easy to watch/listen/read your purchases on just about
any device, just by signing in.

### Web/tech stuff ###

* [LastPass](http://www.lastpass.com/): An encrypted password manager with browser integration, mobile
clients, etc. I pay for LastPass because you can't get the mobile clients otherwise, and there are a 
few other value-adds. And right there, I never have to remember another password again. I really think
that a password manager with good encryption, a long master password, and randomly-generated per-account
passwords make for excellent security.

### Honorable mentions: Free, but I'd totally pay if necessary ###

* [Bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org): A source-code hosting site with free private repositories,
git and mercurial support, and some pretty decent wiki and issue-tracking features. I also like
[Github](http://www.github.com/), and I use it for public projects because it has a larger
mind-share in the software development community, but I generally prefer Bitbucket for personal
stuff.

* [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/): Including Mail, Docs, Calendar, and just about
everything else under the sun. These tools are invaluable, and I love that I can set up Apps
for a personal domain for free with little to no hassle. If I didn't live in a world
dominated by Outlook and MS-Office, I'd do everything in Google's tools.
