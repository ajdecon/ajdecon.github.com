<p>The <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/">Hugo Awards</a> are the premier awards for science fiction and fantasy. The winners are popularly chosen by the fans themselves... or rather, by the attendees at that year's <a href="http://www.renovationsf.org/">Worldcon</a>. It's always seemed cool to me that the most prestigious awards in SFF are popularly-elected, but having been a poor student for most of my life, I haven't been able to make it to a Worldcon. (This year is <a href="http://www.renovationsf.org/">Renovation</a> in Reno, so I still probably can't make it.) And even though you can buy a voting-only "supporting" membership for $50, that and the cost of all the books to vote on still seemed like too much of a barrier to consider voting for the Hugos. <p /> Except now I've learned that for the past few years, the always-amusing <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/">John Scalzi</a> has been organizing the <a href="http://www.renovationsf.org/hugo-packet.php">Hugo Voters Packet</a>: electronic editions of the nominees' work, free to anyone with a supporting membership. Suddenly, $50 membership isn't just the right to vote in the Hugos. It's a massive collection of the best science fiction and fantasy of the past year, in a convenient format, at a great value. (And it's completely official, now that Scalzi is President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.)<p /> So I'm sure you're not surprised that I just payed for my $50 supporting membership at Renovation and downloaded all that shiny, shiny SF. This year's offerings clock in at 904 MB, zipped! (244 MB without the Graphic Novel nominees), for which I think $50 is ridiculously cheap. The ebooks are all in DRM-free RTF, PDF, MOBI or EPUB, which means that they should all be easy to convert and stick on my Kindle. And the Graphic Novels are PDFs... Maybe I talk <a href="http://www.twitter.com/liylak">Leigh</a> into letting me borrow her iPad for those... <p /> So if you enjoy science fiction and fantasy, <a href="http://www.renovationsf.org/cart-intro.php">go sign up for a membership</a>, support your fan community, and download some awesome fiction. Really, why not?</p>
