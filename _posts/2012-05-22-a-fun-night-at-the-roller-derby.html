<p>This past weekend was the season opener for the <a href="http://www.twincityderbygirls.com/">Twin City Derby Girls</a>, the local roller derby league in Champaign, and it was a ridiculous amount of fun. It was also probably the last regular roller derby bout I'll get to see in Champaign (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ajdecon/status/202566193167601664">since we're moving soon</a>), so it was a good thing that this was the most fun I've had at a Derby event so far. Always nice to go out on a high note.</p>
<p><!--more--><p /> The event was a double-header. The first bout was a really <br />evenly-matched event between the local league's <a href="http://twincityderbygirls.com/site/about/teams-staff/itemlist/category/4-damagin-dames">Damagin' Dames</a> and the visiting <a href="http://aurora88s.com/">Aurora 88s</a>, from Aurora, IL. And by evenly-matched, I mean there were <br />about 100 lead changes throughout the bout. Both teams played really <br />well, and until the last 10 minutes or so there was no sense that <br />either team would out-match the other. The Dames had a lot of turnover <br />this year, as a bunch of their players decided to play only on the <br />TCDG Travelers (all-stars), but I was impressed by how well the new <br />skaters were doing. It was a lot of fun to watch, and when the 88s <br />finally pulled ahead near the end, it was obvious that their victory <br />was hard-fought. <p /> The second bout of the night was between two local teams, the <a href="http://twincityderbygirls.com/site/about/teams-staff/itemlist/category/3-boneyard-bombshells">Boneyard Bombshells</a> and <a href="http://twincityderbygirls.com/site/about/teams-staff/itemlist/category/2-the-paign">The Paign</a>. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Leigh_47">Leigh</a> has <br />been playing with the Paign this year, and this bout was important: <br />the Paign had not yet won a home-team bout. The Bombshells have been <br />the team to beat since their inception two years ago, but this time <br />their position was uncertain: they lost the championship to the Dames <br />last year, and like the Dames they've had a lot of turnover since last <br />season. Was this the night for the Paign to begin their comeback? <p /> As it turned out, yes: The Paign won the bout with a score of 117-83! <br />Despite the Paign being ahead the entire time, it was also a really <br />excellent roller derby bout, and featured the highest standard of play <br />I've seen yet from a local TCDG bout. <p /> And to top it all off, Leigh was awarded MVP for her team by the <br />Bombshells! Which was a pretty awesome cap to the night, and (in my <br />possibly biased opinion) totally deserved. She did some pretty awesome <br />blocking in that bout. <p /> Also, The Paign had a lot of fun at halftime: <p /> <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vrg1EurnlDk?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p>
