Being a list of things I read and enjoyed over the past week.

### HPC

* [DOE HPC Operational Review: "Enabling Data-Driven Scientific Discovery at DOE HPC Facilities"](http://www.nersc.gov/assets/HPCOR/HPCOR-Data-2014.pdf) -- A long read, but interesting if you like thinking about how large HPC centers work

### Distributed Systems

* [A quick comparison of Mesos and Yarn](http://blog.typeobject.com/a-quick-comparison-of-mesos-and-yarn) from [Jon Bringhurst](https://twitter.com/jonbringhurst) -- Highlights some interesting relative strengths

* [Mesos: A Platform for Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in the Data Center](https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/mesos.pdf) -- The original paper on Mesos, which does a better job of explaining how resource offers and multiple schedulers work than most blog posts on the topic. :-)

* [Getting Real About Distributed System Reliability](http://blog.empathybox.com/post/19574936361/getting-real-about-distributed-system-reliability) from [Jay Kreps](https://twitter.com/jaykreps)

### Tech culture

* [The First Rule of DevOps Club](http://bridgetkromhout.com/blog/2014/11/03/the-first-rule-of-devops-club/) from [Bridget Kromhout](https://twitter.com/bridgetkromhout) -- Inclusion, it's for winners.

### Fiction

* [Coming Home](http://www.amazon.com/Coming-Home-Alex-Benedict-Novel/dp/0425260879), the latest [Alex Benedict series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/42152-alex-benedict) novel from [Jack McDevitt](http://www.jackmcdevitt.com/)

* [Wings to the Kingdom](http://www.amazon.com/Wings-Kingdom-Cherie-Priest/dp/B001OMHU7Y) by [Cherie Priest](http://www.cheriepriest.com/)

* [Tomorrow Is Waiting](http://www.strangehorizons.com/2011/20111121/tomorrow-f.shtml) by Holli Mintzer

* [A Few Questions About the Culture: An Interview with Iain Banks](http://www.strangehorizons.com/2014/20141103/1banks-a.shtml) -- Not fiction in itself, but commentary on it. Banks is always excellent. Also, you should [donate to Strange Horizons](http://www.strangehorizons.com/fund_drives/2014/main.shtml).

### Randomness

* [Chris Osborn](https://twitter.com/FozzTexx) has a real live BBS running on an Apple IIgs: [bbs.fozztexx.com](http://bbs.fozztexx.com/)
