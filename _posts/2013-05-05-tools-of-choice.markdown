This list encompasses 95% of my daily computer usage, and captures
most of the tools that make my life easier, both at work and 
for general use. I re-do this list every once in a while, 
partly for my future reference and I guess partly for nerd cred. ;-)

### HPC and sysadmin stuff

* Linux provisioning: [Warewulf](http://warewulf.lbl.gov) for HPC or
sometimes [Cobbler](http://www.cobblerd.org/)
    * But also looking into [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/) for some things
    * And of course I use [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/) a lot for when I don't need to own the hardware
* Configuration management: [Ansible](http://www.ansible.cc) is my current favorite, and
I occasionally use [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef)
* Parallel SSH: [pdsh](https://code.google.com/p/pdsh/)
* Cluster resource management: [SLURM](http://slurm.schedmd.com/) or sometimes 
[Torque](https://github.com/adaptivecomputing/torque)
* Monitoring with [Warewulf](http://www.warewulf.lbl.gov) (monitor and NHC) and 
[Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/) 

### Programming

* For almost all prototyping, and many final projects: [Python](http://www.python.org)
    * Except networking stuff where I care about performance: [Go](http://www.golang.org/)
    * Or sometimes when I need to dig into the guts: [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
* For scientific computing: [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/)
    * Except when I use [Fortran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran)
    * And [Julia](http://www.julialang.org) is also fun

### General-use tools:

* For web browsing, mostly I use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) 
like everyone else
* Terminal-multiplexing: [GNU Screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)
* Command-line mail client: [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org/)
* IRC: [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/)
* Command-line twitter: [TTYtter](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/)
* Desktop virtualization: [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/)

### Time-wasting

* [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)
* [Nethack](http://www.nethack.org/)
* See also [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) and [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/)
