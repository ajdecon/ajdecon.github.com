<p>A current partial snapshot of my <em>personal, educational</em>&nbsp;to-do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work through the <a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/Main_Page">Metasploit Unleashed</a> tutorial (security)</li>
<li>Read through some old study materials for the SANS security bootcamp (security)</li>
<li>Work through the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ground-Up-Jonathan-Bartlett/dp/0975283847">Programming From The Ground Up</a>&nbsp;book on assembly language (programming)</li>
<li>Work through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-2nd-Edition/dp/0131103628">K&amp;R C</a> to refresh my C skills (programming)</li>
<li>Work through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/CUDA-Example-Introduction-General-Purpose-Programming/dp/0131387685">CUDA By Example</a>&nbsp;(programming)</li>
<li>Set up my Raspberry Pi as a home server (syadmin)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Find more recipes for tofu that I can eat as a meat-eater (cooking)</li>
<li>Find more tasty things I can make on the grill (cooking)<p /></li>
<li>Re-read Feynman Lectures on Physics (science)</li>
<li>Find a decent intro book on epidemiology to find out if it's as interesting as it seems (science)</li>
<li>Work through some more machine learning tutorials, refresh my stats skills (math)</li>
<li>Work through some examples of numerical programming with MPI (math, programming)</li>
</ul>
<p>And that ignores the stuff I need to do for work, and my regular every-day life with laundry and needy cats and a still partially-set-up apartment and fun games and a wonderful wife....</p>
<p>(Not that I'm complaining, I have a wonderful life! But's how's an extra 10 hours per day sound?)</p>
