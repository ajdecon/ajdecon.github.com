While I'm taking a break from coursework this semester to focus on <br />research, I really don't want this to become a semester where I don't <br />learn anything interesting outside my tiny project. I don't want <br />homework deadlines, but I do want to keep my brain expanding. <p /> Usefully, I've just discovered a <a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=348ca38a-3a6d-4052-937d-cb017338d7b1">machine learning course</a> from Stanford which has all the lectures, videos, <br />etc. up on the web. This seems like something reasonable for me to <br />play with during some downtime, especially since machine learning and <br />statistics are things I've always been interested in. It also seems <br />like a good excuse to keep this blog revitalized. :) <p /> I'll start on lecture 1, and as I go try to summarize the essential <br />features as I go. Watch this space.
