      <p><em>[[posterous-content:cqlBEjozEpbejkxFqaHD]]Warning: purely subjective rambling follows. Not trying to start a flame war. (But hey, I have half an hour to kill.)</em></p>
<p>A little over a month ago, <a href="http://blog.ajdecon.org/adam-gets-a-macbook-and-its-not-the-end-of-th">my Lenovo Thinkpad netbook suffered yet another hardware failure and I bought a Macbook Air</a>, more or less in disgust. Most of my problems with recent PCs had been with the chassis&#8217; physical build quality, and if nothing else, Apple seems to do a decent job on that front. I had never used Mac OS before for any length of time, but I took the risk on the assumption that I&#8217;d treat the Mac like I did my Windows PCs: mostly work in Linux VMs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I preface all this by saying that I&#8217;ve had no complaints whatsoever with the physical Macbook: the chassis is rock-solid, the design is as shiny as everyone said, and I adjusted to its physical layout almost instantly. Cudos to Apple there.</p>
<p>As for the OS, I have mixed impressions. In my personal experience&#8230;</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3>Things Mac OS is great for:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everyday command-line tasks.</strong>&nbsp;I really like that my host operating system actually has a sane command-line, as opposed to Windows where I muddled through with a mix of Cygwin and PowerShell. There are some funky choices for what tools are included and left out &#8211; mainstay tools like <em>watch</em>&nbsp;aren&#8217;t included by default! &#8211; but it&#8217;s still nicer than Windows.</li>
<li><strong>Working with remote systems.</strong>&nbsp;Related to the last point: I <em>love</em>&nbsp;having OpenSSH in the base system.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual desktops.</strong>&nbsp;Or &#8220;Spaces&#8221; in Mac parlance. Still not as nice as Linux virtual desktops, but acceptable most of the time.</li>
<li><strong>LaTeX editing.</strong>&nbsp;I find MacTeX at least as usable as Windows MikTeX, and easier to use than dealing with LaTeX package management on Linux. It&#8217;s possible I haven&#8217;t dug into the Linux LaTeX experience sufficiently, but for the moment the Mac wins on typesetting.</li>
<li><strong>Anything involving a web browser.</strong>&nbsp;But that isn&#8217;t really a differentiator, so is Linux, Windows, and anything else where you can install Chrome or Firefox. I should say, I find the built-in browser (Safari) almost as unpleasant as Internet Explorer.</li>
<li><strong>Shininess. </strong>Aesthetics matter even to me, and it&#8217;s absolutely the <em>prettiest</em>&nbsp;operating system I have ever used.</li>
<li><strong>Fellow users&#8217; tech-saviness.</strong> I don&#8217;t know how it was in OS 9 days, but OS X does seem to attract a more knowledgeable class of users than Windows. A much higher proportion seem to know about the command line, occasionally use it for something useful, or even start up a Python interpreter to program something. I like it. (Linux is higher, but there are a lot fewer of us.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things it&#8217;s less good for:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Package management.</strong>&nbsp;Windows isn&#8217;t good at this either, but that&#8217;s no excuse. Third-party package managers like Homebrew are nice, but not an acceptable replacement for apt-get or yum. The Mac App Store seems like to might be trying to turn into a package manager, but I have my own issues with that.</li>
<li><strong>Gaming.</strong>&nbsp;It isn&#8217;t as bad as I&#8217;d thought it might be, based on admittedly older impressions, but the support of games for OS X is still not great.</li>
<li><strong>Platform IDE.</strong>&nbsp;If you think that Xcode is an acceptable replacement for Visual Studio, you and I are living in different universes. Not that I spend much time in IDEs, and the Mac scores points for making it easier to work with standard Unix tools, but every once in a while I might want to put a GUI on something not in a web browser.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Software development. </strong>In general I still find the dev experience much much friendlier on Linux.&nbsp;I concede that my complaints are less relevant in web development, and based mostly on my HPC bias: In particular anything involving Fortran, C, OpenMP, MPI, or integration with high-performance libraries is just painful in Mac OS. OK, if all you want to do is serve a web page, it does ok&#8230; but even then, performance sucks compared to Linux.</li>
<li><strong>Generic technical friendliness. </strong>Wherein I lump the points where Apple makes it less friendly to be a technical user of their software, including:   
<ul>
<li>Worse developer tools in general than both Windows and Linux.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Worse outreach to developers than Microsoft.</li>
<li>Less useful technical forums&#8230; which is odd, considering how many more users (by percent) seem to be technical.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fellow users&#8217; response to complaints.</strong>&nbsp;Is this the flip side to the better tech-saviness? Every operating system has something to complain about, but in my personal experience, Mac users react much worse to unfavorable reviews than other users. I previously thought this might just be a stereotype, useful for making jokes, but then I ran into it myself. If you say &#8220;[Operating System] really freaking sucks at doing [Useful Task], can you help me out?&#8221;, the responses seem to be:   
<ul>
<li><strong>Linux: Over-technical but maybe working solution.</strong> &#8220;Oh yeah, I&#8217;ve had trouble with that too. But you know, it works better if you re-compile the kernel with these options, uninstall the app package and install from source with this other option, and/or reset your BIOS like so.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Windows: Suggestion of alternate software that fulfills 80% use-case.</strong> &#8220;Microsoft sucks! I wish they&#8217;d fix that. But in the mean time, there&#8217;s this other software that you can download for free (if lucky) / pay $19.99 for (consumer) / pay $3000 for (enterprise) that should get you most of the way.</li>
<li><strong>Mac: Questioning of your worth as a human being.</strong> &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why you&#8217;d even want to do [Useful Task]. That seems worthless. And by complaining, you&#8217;ve just shown that You Don&#8217;t Understand.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite my comlaints, though, I&#8217;m enjoying it more than Windows on the whole. I have a Windows 7 VM installed, but it&#8217;s not getting tons of use (except some gaming) and I do find myself spending a lot of time in OS X.</p>
<p>I still have a Linux VM open almost all the time, though.</p>
