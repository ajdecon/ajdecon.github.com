    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790854-you">YOU</a>, by Austin Grossman,
is a novel about video games, growing up with your high school friends,
and figuring out what the hell you
really want to do with the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Our lead character is Russell, a 28-year-old English major who has wandered
through several possible careers with no particular attachment or aptitude for
any of them, and at the beginning of the novel he is interviewing with a video
game studio. Black Arts, the studio in question, was founded by a
couple of his friends from high school; but while Russell was peripherally
involved in building the first version of the studio's game engine
(as part of a group project back in school), he hasn't been involved for a long
time and barely squeaks in as an entry-level designer.</p>

<p>All of Black Arts games follow the same four characters, a pretty standard
four-person D&amp;D-style adventuring party including a warrior named Brennan,
a thief named Prendar, a wizard named Lorac,
and a female warrior named Leira. Starting with
a high fantasy series called <em>Realms of Gold</em>, these four characters are
then re-purposed and
re-used for anything from espionage to science fiction to golf
and go-cart games.</p>

<p>The adventuring party roughly mirrors the original
four-person group that built the game back in high school: Simon, the
enigmatic genius (and wizard), now deceased; Darren, Simon's partner in
co-founding Black Arts (and warrior); Lisa, a brilliant programmer in her own
right, but disconnected from the world (similar to Leira);
and Russell, who seems to me less a thief than someone who just doesn't know
what do do with his life.</p>

<p>While the novel follows Russell and the Black Arts team through the development
of the next installment in their <em>Realms of Gold</em> series, and through
various adventures in the realm of making video games, this really is
the story of those four characters: a group of misfits who banded together in
high school, then found their own paths after graduation after they
discovered they were going to be stuck living in the real world after all.
The story makes frequent use of flashbacks to high school, a computer summer
camp, college, and other moments which help us learn about how these four
grew up together and then grew apart.</p>

<p>I enjoyed this novel immensely (and finished it within 24 hours of purchasing
it!),
but it had its ups and downs. Much of the story felt a little "dream-like":
large parts of the novel either consisted of flashbacks to Russel's past,
imagined flashbacks about what Simon or Lisa might have been feeling at the
same time, or conversations between Russell and the actual adventurers from
the Black Arts games.</p>

<p>In a way, this worked -- a lot of the story
took place hacking on games at two in the morning, and I know from personal
experience that things do feel a little dream-like during those moments -- but
it made up so much of the novel that it lost a bit of its immediacy. Perhaps
because of this, Russell felt so detached from the outcome of his company's
struggles that it became hard to care much as the reader.</p>

<p>However, all that is really a minor quibble.
The story of Black Arts was a lot of fun to read,
and offers much to the reader who knows
games. It's set in the late 90's, a pretty good time for video games in my
opinion, and there are all sorts of great nostalgia references for anyone who
grew up playing video games around that time. I also enjoy Grossman's writing
style quite a lot, both here and in his superhero novel <em>Soon I Will Be
Invincible</em>.</p>

<p>Call it 8/10.</p>

    <updated>2012-10-26T01:42:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://ajdecon.github.com/physics-book-recommendations-number-askolo-rescued-answer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.askolo.com">Askolo</a> is a question-answer site
<a href="http://blog.ajdecon.org/some-thoughts-on-hpc-in-the-cloud-askolo-ques/">I played with for a while</a>, but it was recently accounced that
the site was going into maintenance mode so the startup in question could focus on other projects. It's a little sad, but
my own usage of the site did tail off pretty quickly. I did have a couple of answers there which I put a little
thought into, so I might rescue a few of them as blog posts. Here's one.</em></p>

<h4>Q: Do you have any recommendations for high quality physics books? (I've been enjoying the Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics recently).</h4>

<p>A: It's been a little while since I sat down with a good physics text, but here are some I remember liking:</p>

<h4>General physics:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Anything of Feynman's is good, particularly his Lectures on Physics and The Character of Physical Law (absolutely one of my favorite short physics books). One exception: they're selling a book of problem sets with his lectures now, but to be honest I didn't care for them much.</li>
<li>Quantum Physics by Eisberg and Resnick - I remember liking this as a good general intro for quantum physics, but it doesn't use braket notation which quite bothered me at the time.</li>
<li>I also used Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Shankar, which did provide a really good introduction to braket notation but I thought did less well with the actual physics</li>
<li>Griffiths wrote decent if unexciting texts on Electrodynamics and Quantum Physics, which are very well-regarded by many</li>
<li>Introductory Statistical Mechanics by Bowley and Sanchez - One of the most readable intros to stat-mech I've found</li>
<li>Introduction to Solid State Physics by Kittel - Another classic recommendation, but still an excellent solid state book. I actually bought this for myself and read it despite having no solid state class that semester, and found it fun.</li>
<li>Not a textbook, but George Gamow's "Thirty Years That Shook Physics" is a nicely readable history of the early development of quantum physics by someone who lived through it.</li>
</ul>


<p>AVOID "Electromagnetism" by Pollack and Stump, and "Optical Waves in Crystals" by Yariv and Yeh. I found both books intensely unpleasant.</p>

<p>Edit: I notice after-the-fact that there's not a single book on classical mechanics in above list, except Feynman. I honestly just never liked any of them. Perhaps I should read Newton? :-)</p>

<h4>Materials science, soft-matter physics and polymer physics:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Electronic Materials and Devices by Kasap - My second intro to solid state physics, and perhaps it was strictly more useful than Kittel: I remember the problem sets being much better. It was much more focused on the materials science and practical engineering.</li>
<li>Molecular Driving Forces by Dill and Bromberg - Starts as another stat-mech book, but flows into some generic materials science and polymer physics</li>
<li>Polymer Physics by Rubinstein and Colby - This is a truly excellent introductory text on polymer physics and rheology, and explains the weird statistical ways that polymeric materials behave in a much clearer fashion than most of the books I found.</li>
<li>Structure and Rheology of Complex Fluids by Larson - I actually really hated the experience of reading this book, but it's the best survey I've found for all the weird things viscoelastic materials do. I read it mostly for the references.</li>
</ul>


<p>Hope you find something useful in there!</p>

    <link href="http://ajdecon.github.com/zombies-as-real-science-fiction-a-review-of-f/"/>
    <updated>2011-06-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://ajdecon.github.com/zombies-as-real-science-fiction-a-review-of-f</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year I read a novel by Mira Grant (aka Seanan McGuire) called <em>Feed</em>. I picked it up because of the cover: the symbol for an RSS feed, drawn in blood, and a blurb of some sort indicating that it was about zombies. I was on a bit of a zombie kick at the time (because let's face it, zombies are <em>cool</em>), and I figured what the hell. Ten bucks, right?</p>


<p><p /> </p>
<p>It was <em>awesome</em>.</p>
<p><p /> </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feed-Newsflesh-Book-Mira-Grant/dp/0316081051"><em>Feed</em></a></strong> takes place in a world in which the zombies rose, but life went on. In this world, zombies come back to life because of a pair of artificial viruses--a cancer cure, and a cure for the common cold--which were released too early, and interacted very badly. Every person in the world, or mammal over forty pounds, has these viruses. And when they die, whether by accident or natural causes or whatever, they wake up again and start trying to infect anyone nearby. Which means it's not only the zombies you need to watch out for: it's that old dude in line at the supermarket who looks like he might have a heart attack. 'Cause if he does, next thing he's going to do is try to eat you.</p>
<p><p /> </p>
<p>The fun of <em>Feed</em> is that rather than try to be a horror movie, it does political intrigue. It starts a good 20 years after the initial outbreak, in a world that has learned to live with the ever-present zombie threat. The main characters are a pair of bloggers, a brother and sister named Shaun and Georgia, who are covering the a US presidential campaign. Grant does a masterful job of leading the voters, and the readers, through the changes in this new America. Some issues which were long contested, like the death penalty, seem almost silly: if you put someone to death and he gets up to start eating people, the point is somewhat lost. Some are still just as real: abortion, civil rights, and the proper scope of government don't get settled by the Living Dead. And many new issues crop up, mostly related to the best way to structure a society in which every dead person becomes a zombie. But while the zombies are a big part of the story, they aren't the story themselves, which was very refreshing.</p>
<p><p /> </p>
<p>The characters are also fun and well-written. Shaun and Georgia snark as only siblings do, while still making it clear that each of them cares about the other more than anything in the world. The candidates for President are all believable, though the author and our heroes are obviously believable. And every other character is written such that you can believe they are a person... and you can see the unique personal scars that living in a zombie world has given them.</p>
<p><p /> </p>
<p><em>Feed</em> works as a pretty good political thriller, and I thought that was that. But then the sequel came out, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031608106X/"><em>Deadline</em></a></strong>, and it just blew me away.</p>
<p><p /> </p>
<p>While the first novel wrapped up the political plot, there are enough loose ends to pull on for you to see there's more going on. If <em>Feed</em> was "political science fiction", <em>Deadline</em> is <em>epidemiology fiction</em>. Zombieism spreads like a virus, because that's what it is--and viruses mutate, and change, and act in funny ways when conditions change. Our heroes start right in the thick of things, as we discover that the corruption glimpsed before has spread all the way into the CDC--an organization which is treated as above reproach in the first novel. And then things get crazy. I can't say much more for fear of spoilers, but the end of the novel made my brain hurt in a good way. And I'm so frustrated that I'll probably have to wait for a year to read <em>Blackout</em>, the third novel of the "Newsflesh" trilogy.</p>
<p><p /> </p>
<p>These novels have fun and believable characters; fast, interesting plots; and a refreshing take on an old horror standby. I <em>love</em> that zombies are brought firmly into the realm of science fiction here. Too often they're just a convenient way to make you jump, or simply not thought out thoroughly. But you can tell that Grant has done her research, and has thought through almost every detail of how this world should work, while still not letting it get in the way of a good story. And besides, epidemiology doesn't get enough literary love.</p>
<p><p /> </p>
<p><em>Feed</em> is nominated for the Hugos this year, and while I haven't finished reading the other Best Novel nominees, I have to see they've got their work cut out for them. Read these books: they're awesome.</p>
<p><p /> </p>
<p><a href="http://miragrant.com/">Mira Grant's</a> real name is <a href="http://seananmcguire.com/">Seanan McGuire</a>, but she writes under both names in different genres. (And Mira Grant is a better horror name, don't you think?) <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/SEANANMCGUIRE">Her twitter</a>&nbsp;is also always amusing, and has bits with cats in it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/">Hugo Awards</a> are the premier awards for science fiction and fantasy. The winners are popularly chosen by the fans themselves... or rather, by the attendees at that year's <a href="http://www.renovationsf.org/">Worldcon</a>. It's always seemed cool to me that the most prestigious awards in SFF are popularly-elected, but having been a poor student for most of my life, I haven't been able to make it to a Worldcon. (This year is <a href="http://www.renovationsf.org/">Renovation</a> in Reno, so I still probably can't make it.) And even though you can buy a voting-only "supporting" membership for $50, that and the cost of all the books to vote on still seemed like too much of a barrier to consider voting for the Hugos. <p /> Except now I've learned that for the past few years, the always-amusing <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/">John Scalzi</a> has been organizing the <a href="http://www.renovationsf.org/hugo-packet.php">Hugo Voters Packet</a>: electronic editions of the nominees' work, free to anyone with a supporting membership. Suddenly, $50 membership isn't just the right to vote in the Hugos. It's a massive collection of the best science fiction and fantasy of the past year, in a convenient format, at a great value. (And it's completely official, now that Scalzi is President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.)<p /> So I'm sure you're not surprised that I just payed for my $50 supporting membership at Renovation and downloaded all that shiny, shiny SF. This year's offerings clock in at 904 MB, zipped! (244 MB without the Graphic Novel nominees), for which I think $50 is ridiculously cheap. The ebooks are all in DRM-free RTF, PDF, MOBI or EPUB, which means that they should all be easy to convert and stick on my Kindle. And the Graphic Novels are PDFs... Maybe I talk <a href="http://www.twitter.com/liylak">Leigh</a> into letting me borrow her iPad for those... <p /> So if you enjoy science fiction and fantasy, <a href="http://www.renovationsf.org/cart-intro.php">go sign up for a membership</a>, support your fan community, and download some awesome fiction. Really, why not?</p>

    <link href="http://ajdecon.github.com/turn-coat-book-11-of-the-dresden-files-jim-bu/"/>
    <updated>2009-04-18T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://ajdecon.github.com/turn-coat-book-11-of-the-dresden-files-jim-bu</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I got my copy of Turn Coat, book 11 of Jim Butcher's Dresden <br />Files series. For the uninitiated, the Dresden Files follows the <br />adventures of Harry Dresden, the only wizard in Chicago's Yellow <br />Pages. Starting out mostly as a PI with some magical abilities, in <br />recent books Harry's adventures have shaded into more standard <br />urban-fantasy stories of magic, mystery and conspiracy. Especially <br />conspiracy, as Harry and others have come to the conclusion that there <br />must be a traitor in the ranks of the White Council, the governing <br />body of wizardry in this world. <br />&nbsp;<br />The book opens immediately with Harry answering his front door to find <br />Morgan, a long-time antagonist and Warden of the White Council who <br />thinks of Harry as a dangerous threat, asking for sanctuary from the <br />Council himself on a charge of murder. Harry, being a glutton for <br />punishment, of course allows him inside and decides that Morgan is <br />innocent. This sets off a chain of chaotic events in which everyone <br />is looking for Morgan, Harry is attempting to prove his innocence and <br />the involvement of the real traitor, and various friends and denizens <br />of Chicago are caught in the middle. <br />&nbsp;<br />Without giving away too many details, it's debatable whether the end <br />of this novel can really be called a victory. Harry technically <br />"wins" as usual, but he loses a lot in the process, and damages a <br />number of relationships and alliances along the way. He doesn't seem <br />to have gained much in the process, unlike previous books where he has <br />met new allies or gained new knowledge. <br />&nbsp;<br />Jim Butcher has talked about how the Dresden files will be a long <br />series with an "apocalyptic trilogy" at the end, and it's apparent <br />that this might be the turning point at which things start to get a <br />lot darker.  As a story I felt this was a stronger installment than <br />the last novel, "Small Favor", which didn't feel as tight or focused <br />to me as this latest one. At the same time I'm not sure how much I'm <br />looking forward to the next Dresden Files novel: this series has <br />always had its fair share of darkness but were lightened by Harry's <br />humor and relationships with his friends. As things get darker in <br />this world and alliances become strained, it's hard to see how much <br />light will be present as the series goes on... which may forward the <br />plot, but also lose a large part of why the series was so enjoyable in <br />the first place.</p>
