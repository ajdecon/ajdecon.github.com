<p>Just for fun,
I recently built a small HPC-style computing cluster out of five
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> servers.  While this kind of
thing has of course been <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/features/raspberry_pi_supercomputer.shtml">done</a>
<a href="http://coen.boisestate.edu/ece/raspberry-pi/">before</a>, I wanted to build one
anyway as a geek toy and a platform for me to play with a few HPC ideas.</p>

<p>I think it actually turned out rather well, and it was a ridiculous amount of
fun to build. My wife <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Leigh_47">Leigh</a> helped put together
the Lego rack, and it was a lot of fun to put together. Because I was focusing more on
duplicating a "real" cluster rather than getting performance, I included all the usual
cluster services such as a <a href="http://slurm.schedmd.com">SLURM</a> scheduler,
<a href="http://ganglia.sourceforge.net">Ganglia</a> for monitoring, and using one of the
Pi's as a non-computing login node. Total <a href="http://gist.github.com/ajdecon/6045818">HPL performance</a>,
670 MFlops. Oh yeah!</p>

<p>A few folks at <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/">NVIDIA</a>, where I also work on HPC clusters,
also thought this was a cool project. The Pi cluster thus ended up being featured
as an "Inner Geek" post on the
<a href="http://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2013/07/17/raspberry-pi/">company blog</a>, alongside
other awesome projects from NVIDIANs such as a
<a href="http://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2013/05/23/inner-geek-restoring-my-fathers-meyers-aero-commander/">cool airplane restoration</a>
and an <a href="http://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2012/11/28/inner-geek-nvidia-engineer-serves-up-holiday-lights-gangnam-style/">amazing holiday lights display</a>.</p>

<p>If you're curious, I have details on how I put it together in my
<a href="https://github.com/ajdecon/ansible-pi-cluster">ansible-pi-cluster</a> GitHub
repository. This includes the <a href="http://www.ansible.cc">Ansible</a> playbooks
I used to install all the software (though they still need some work), as
well as some notes on the physical assembly and OS provisioning in the
<a href="https://github.com/ajdecon/ansible-pi-cluster/blob/master/README.md">README</a>.</p>

<p>I'll admit that the <a href="http://gist.github.com/ajdecon/6045818">performance isn't awesome</a>
compared to other clusters
(or even many laptops!), but I like having a cluster I can hold in my hands:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ajdecon-public/PiWithLegos.jpg" width=600></p>

<p>There are all sorts of other "tiny HPC cluster" projects out there,
frequently used for teaching, and which have often done some real science.<br/>
Here's a short roundup of some other tiny clusters I've seen...
And if you know something else I should include in this post, let me know
and I'll add it in.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~sjc/raspberrypi/">Idris-Pi</a>,
the original Raspberry Pi + Legos supercomputer from Southampton University.
This cluster included 64 Raspberry Pi boards, and they also have some
<a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~sjc/raspberrypi/pi_supercomputer_southampton.htm">instructions</a>
posted for how they set up the software stack.  There was also a very
interesting discussion of this cluster on the
<a href="http://www.beowulf.org/pipermail/beowulf/2012-September/029953.html">Beowulf list</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://coen.boisestate.edu/ece/files/2013/05/Creating.a.Raspberry.Pi-Based.Beowulf.Cluster_v2.pdf">RPiCluster</a>
from Boise State, a 32-node cluster built by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jkiepert">Joshua Kiepert</a>
to use for his dissertation research. This link also includes detailed instructions on building
his cluster.</li>
</ul>

<br/><br/>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://littlefe.net/">LittleFe</a> is an ongoing project focused on building
small educational HPC clusters which teachers can use in their classes.
Their web site includes a continually-updated design for a 6-node cluster
of Intel Atom processors, and their organization also holds build events at
conferences such as <a href="http://www.supercomp.org/">SuperComputing</a> where
interested teachers can build clusters they can take home.</li>
</ul>
