    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.askolo.com">Askolo</a> is a question-answer site
<a href="http://blog.ajdecon.org/some-thoughts-on-hpc-in-the-cloud-askolo-ques/">I played with for a while</a>, but it was recently accounced that
the site was going into maintenance mode so the startup in question could focus on other projects. It's a little sad, but
my own usage of the site did tail off pretty quickly. I did have a couple of answers there which I put a little
thought into, so I might rescue a few of them as blog posts. Here's one.</em></p>

<h4>Q: Do you have any recommendations for high quality physics books? (I've been enjoying the Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics recently).</h4>

<p>A: It's been a little while since I sat down with a good physics text, but here are some I remember liking:</p>

<h4>General physics:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Anything of Feynman's is good, particularly his Lectures on Physics and The Character of Physical Law (absolutely one of my favorite short physics books). One exception: they're selling a book of problem sets with his lectures now, but to be honest I didn't care for them much.</li>
<li>Quantum Physics by Eisberg and Resnick - I remember liking this as a good general intro for quantum physics, but it doesn't use braket notation which quite bothered me at the time.</li>
<li>I also used Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Shankar, which did provide a really good introduction to braket notation but I thought did less well with the actual physics</li>
<li>Griffiths wrote decent if unexciting texts on Electrodynamics and Quantum Physics, which are very well-regarded by many</li>
<li>Introductory Statistical Mechanics by Bowley and Sanchez - One of the most readable intros to stat-mech I've found</li>
<li>Introduction to Solid State Physics by Kittel - Another classic recommendation, but still an excellent solid state book. I actually bought this for myself and read it despite having no solid state class that semester, and found it fun.</li>
<li>Not a textbook, but George Gamow's "Thirty Years That Shook Physics" is a nicely readable history of the early development of quantum physics by someone who lived through it.</li>
</ul>


<p>AVOID "Electromagnetism" by Pollack and Stump, and "Optical Waves in Crystals" by Yariv and Yeh. I found both books intensely unpleasant.</p>

<p>Edit: I notice after-the-fact that there's not a single book on classical mechanics in above list, except Feynman. I honestly just never liked any of them. Perhaps I should read Newton? :-)</p>

<h4>Materials science, soft-matter physics and polymer physics:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Electronic Materials and Devices by Kasap - My second intro to solid state physics, and perhaps it was strictly more useful than Kittel: I remember the problem sets being much better. It was much more focused on the materials science and practical engineering.</li>
<li>Molecular Driving Forces by Dill and Bromberg - Starts as another stat-mech book, but flows into some generic materials science and polymer physics</li>
<li>Polymer Physics by Rubinstein and Colby - This is a truly excellent introductory text on polymer physics and rheology, and explains the weird statistical ways that polymeric materials behave in a much clearer fashion than most of the books I found.</li>
<li>Structure and Rheology of Complex Fluids by Larson - I actually really hated the experience of reading this book, but it's the best survey I've found for all the weird things viscoelastic materials do. I read it mostly for the references.</li>
</ul>


<p>Hope you find something useful in there!</p>
