    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those who haven't heard yet: Leigh and I are moving to Santa Fe! I
am joining the HPC-3 team at Los Alamos National Lab as a Cluster
Administrator helping to manage the Lab's production HPC systems.
Leigh will be skating with <a href="http://www.dukecityderby.com/">Duke City Roller Derby</a>...
and is also in process on her new job hunt, but we all know roller derby is
the important thing. ;-)</p>

<p>I really enjoyed my time at NVIDIA and in the Bay Area, and there are many
people we'll miss there... but I'm also really excited for my new position
at the Lab, and Santa Fe looks like it will be an awesome place to live.</p>

<p>Leigh and I loaded the cats in the car this morning to begin
the long drive to New Mexico, and we will be arriving in Santa Fe this weekend.
I'm starting at LANL on June 16. If you're in the area of Santa Fe or Los Alamos and want
to meet up for beer/coffee/etc, let me know!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three of this year's Resolutions (or at least, strong intentions) have been to exercise more, cook more, and write in this blog more often. Today I made progress in all of these...</p>


<p> <br /><ul> <li><b>Exercise</b>: I haven't been as active lately as I'd like, so more exercise seems like a good idea. So I invoked my motivational tool of last resort: I spent a lot of money on it. Specifically, I got a gym membership, which will both the useful enough to help me exercise and expensive enough for me to not want to waste the money.</li> <li><b>Cooking</b>: Partly for the sake of eating better, partly to spend less money eating out, and also to try some tasty new things. So I spent most of the afternoon cooking today, and made...<ul> <li><a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/crispy-barbequed-tofu-slices/detail.aspx">Barbequed Tofu Slices</a>: The recipe turned out to be more involved than I expected from a cursory reading, but I managed to make it to the end and produce something edible. Fairly tasty actually, and Leigh quite liked it as well. It's also the first tofu dish I can confidently say I enjoyed, so this probably goes into the "will make again" list.</li> <li><a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/34/Garlic-Roasted-Potatoes">Garlic Roasted Potatoes</a>: Pretty simple, but quite tasty, and went well with the tofu.</li> <li><a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/154/Biscotti">Biscotti</a>: These came out surprisingly well. The Cooking for Engineers recipe includes orange zest, and while I used less than called for in the recipe, you can really taste the orange, as well as the almonds and vanilla. I actually like this enough that, if Leigh and I enjoy these over the next week, I might try to bake more biscotti on a weekly basis with different flavors.</li> </ul> </li><li><b>Blogging</b>: As you see here! Also, I'm working on a short entry explaining a <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> recipe I put together this week for building a basic SLURM+OpenMPI compute cluster on Ubuntu servers.<br />One of the things I'd really like to do this year is get better at technical writing, and writing in general, so the blog will actually serve a useful purpose in helping me practice my writing. Even (or especially!) if no one reads it.</li> </ul></p>
