      <p>A week ago today, my <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x120e">Thinkpad</a>&#8217;s keyboard failed for the third time in a year.</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t entirely unexpected (being, after all, the third failure), but it was still very disappointing. &nbsp;Three times in a year, the laptop&#8217;s keyboard failed in the same manner: a number of keys simply stopped working, in a relatively random fashion. &nbsp;Unfortunately these keys were rather important ones, like &#8220;a&#8221;, or &#8220;t&#8221;, or the spacebar. &nbsp;Not the kind of keys you can do without.</p>
<p>The previous two times I was under warranty, called Lenovo, and got the keyboard replaced. &nbsp;This time, I decided enough was enough and simply replaced the laptop with a different model. This time around, I purchased an 11&#8221; Apple Macbook Air.</p>
<p>People who know me well have found this very amusing. In general, I&#8217;m not very much of an Apple fan: the company has continuously demonstrated a disregard for technology standards, I find the App Store paradigm scary (as it has bad implications for general-purpose computing), and they have generally done a poor job of participating in an open-source community which they depend on for much of their software. So why would I buy a Macbook?</p>
<ul>
<li>The industrial design is fantastic (compared to most PC laptops)</li>
<li><em>Some </em>of the hardware is more reliable (mostly the chassis, as internal components are roughly identical)</li>
<li>It interoperates well with the rest of the home network, which includes an Airport/Time Machine, an iMac, and an iPad (per Leigh)</li>
<li>More OS flexibility: instead of just Linux and Windows, I get to choose OS X as well. (without Hackintosh silliness.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is really what decided me, with a healthy consideration of hardware reliabilty included. In recent history all of my laptops have had a native Windows install, but also included a Linux virtual machine in which I spent the majority of my time. On the Macbook, I increase my flexibility a little: now I have OS X as a host operating system, and both Windows and Linux are virtualized. And while I&#8217;m still spending plenty of time in both Windows and Linux, OS X is actually beginning to seem pretty decent.</p>
<p>Five days in, the experience has been pretty good overall, but not perfect. A brief list of pros and cons&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The hardware really is pretty nice. I like the keyboard, it&#8217;s ridiculously thin and light, and it&#8217;s very well-designed for usability.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Performance is similarly good. 4 GB RAM + a 128 GB SSD is quite fast, if not quite as spacious as I like.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve found the default tools in OS X to be pretty usable, and it&#8217;s nice to have a UNIX operating system as my base OS. Most (but not all) of the open-source utilities I expect are all present.</li>
<li>The Terminal app is friendly enough to allocate itself its own virtual desktop (or &#8220;Space&#8221;, or whatever) when in full-screen mode. Nice feature.</li>
<li>Integration with the Apple-centric home network. Having the Time Machine as a convenient and automated backup system is rather nice, though I still might have to invest in a decent RAID for peace-of-mind.</li>
<li>It serves as a <em>very</em>&nbsp;effective host for pretty much any OS I&#8217;ve chosen to test with it. Linux and Windows both work pretty well, though my testing is incomplete. (So far, I spend most of my time in Linux.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I really miss my Thinkpad&#8217;s TrackPoint. The Macbook has the best touchpad I&#8217;ve used, but I loved the TrackPoint.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m having a hard time getting used to various keyboard shortcut variations, but that&#8217;s a minor complaint.</li>
<li>I like the SSD&#8217;s performance, but I&#8217;m having trouble getting used to the space constaints. I&#8217;m a lot more reluctant to build random VMs for testing than I was previously, and that bothers me. Invest in an external VM store?</li>
<li>The sysadmin in me is bothered by the fact that I can&#8217;t open up the case&#8230; but I never really bothered with the Thinkpad either, did I?</li>
<li>I miss having a real package manager (vs Linux). I don&#8217;t care what you tell me, homebrew is <em>not</em>&nbsp;an acceptable alternative. &nbsp;It&#8217;s nowhere near as extensive as a Linux package manager, less stable, and far too focused on the webdev community (vs my native land of scientists and HPC).</li>
<li>Related to the first part: Apple really seems to dislike the GPLv3 license many recent GNU utlities are released under, and so it doesn&#8217;t duplicate Linux utulities very well. (conventional gcc is missing, bash is old, etc.)</li>
<li>OS X is not as stable as I expected&#8230; in particular, I&#8217;m seeing the whole system refuse to restore if I sleep too long with VMs running. <em>That</em>&nbsp;is rather disappointing.</li>
</ul>
<p>So on the whole, a pretty decent laptop. My anti-Mac prejudice, while not entirely unfounded, at least failed to recognize the high build quality of the physical hardware and the fact that it&#8217;s just as usable in Linux as the Thinkpad was. (To recognize the latter fact, I purchased a <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/75571794/tux-penguin-vinyl-decal-sticker-for-the">minor customization</a>&#8230;)</p>
<p>The major question for the future will be which OS I spend the majority of my time in, long-term. I really am impressed with OS X as a UNIX with good hardware support, but the lack of a decent package manager is really frustrating much of the time. Installing scipy should not be that difficult, dammit! So most of my software development and experimentation has still been under Linux, so far.</p>
<p>I do love the hardware, though. I have <em>totally</em>&nbsp;failed my saving throw against shiny this round&#8230;</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/archaeology-as-science-fiction-discovering-ja/">Archaeology as science fiction: Discovering Jack McDevitt</a></h1>
      <p>I generally think of myself as being pretty well-read in terms of science fiction. Not as well as some: I&#8217;ve met people at cons with an encyclopedic knowledge of the field, and who seem to have read every novel by every one-hit wonder who ever published. But I like to think I at least know the classics, even the recent ones. So imagine my surprise when I picked up <em>A Talent For War</em>&nbsp;a couple weeks ago, having never read anything before by Jack McDevitt.</p>
<p>In a field where the &#8220;science&#8221; in science fiction is usually physics, or perhaps biology, McDevitt has staked a powerful claim to the field of archaeology. In <em>A Talent For War</em>, he introduces the character of Alex Benedict, an antiques dealer in a starfaring civilization thousands of years in our future. Benedict claims that his primary interest in the past is his ability to sell it: he collects artifacts and sells them, connects buyers and sellers of ancient cups and computers, and is obviously very fond of money. But Benedict doesn&#8217;t come off as mercenary as he claims, and while he&#8217;ll happily sell the objects he finds to the highest bidder, he displays a tenacious need to discover the truth in a mystery hundreds of years old.</p>
<p><em>A Talent For War</em>&nbsp;follows Benedict in his quest for the truth of a war story central to his future&#8217;s culture, and is generally a fun romp through a well-imagined future universe. Benedict&#8217;s world isn&#8217;t as tightly constructed as in a work by Niven or Asimov, but it hangs together very well and displays a more believable view of humanity than you see in something like <em>Foundation</em>. The only thing that threw me off was how <em>contemporary</em>&nbsp;things seemed: how many physical books there were lying around, the coexistence of everyday technology with stardrives and instant communications, and how culturally similar the future was. McDevitt obviously is not a subscriber to the concept of the Singularity or a coming apocalypse, but that&#8217;s ok: it&#8217;s boring when everyone expects dystopia or transhumanism, and he captures the feel of a Clarke or an Asimov story very well.</p>
<p>The following Benedict books (which I devoured in the course of about a week, all five of them) don&#8217;t use Alex himself as the point-of-view character, but rather his assistant Chase. Chase is actually much more fun: she brings a non-archaeological perspective to these hunts through the mysteries fo the future-past, being a star pilot, and gives us a more complete view of the culture of this world. She does occasionally serve as an audience for Benedict&#8217;s brilliant insights, but she more often sees him being ridiculous, vain, or downright foolish, and has the occasional crowning moment of aweomse herself. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the novels do display the thing I enjoy most about McDevitt&#8217;s work, however: a view of history as a mystery to be solved, and which has consequences for the world we live in today. The idea that archaeology matters, and can be exciting, and can change the way we think about things. These are all mystery novels, at the bottom, but for the most part they don&#8217;t portray action and adventure: rather, they portray careful research, and conversations with people (or their computer-generated avatars) who lived through the events being investigated. The action, when it arrives, is usually the result of the characters&#8217; breakthroughs in their earlier research, and not random chance.</p>
<p>The only criticism I have of the Alex Benedict series is that McDevitt seems to want to raise the stakes in every subsequent book. This is pretty understandable in a series, and it&#8217;s always nice to top your last novel&#8230; but when the first story revolutionizes the historical view of the most important war of the future, the next reveals the truth behind one of the most important scientific discoveries in history, and the third looks into the history of one of the first interstellar colonies&#8230; There are limits to how high you can go, and I feel like McDevitt is pushing it. Give us a fun historical mystery, and the world doesn&#8217;t have to shake with the consequences.</p>
<p>Having exhausted the limits of the Alex Benedict series (so far: the most recent novel, <em>Firebird</em>, was published in November 2011), I circled back to some of McDevitt&#8217;s earlier work. <em>Eternity Road</em>&nbsp;was a fun stand-alone, though not quite as good as the Benedict series: the concept was great, but it felt a little paint-by-numbers at the end. And I&#8217;ve just started <em>The Engines of God, </em>first in another series following another star pilot by the name of Priscilla Hutchins, in a different and somewhat nearer-future world than Alex and Chase&#8217;s.</p>
<p>In any case, I&#8217;m still having fun, and I can recommend Jack McDevitt&#8217;s work without reservation. If you loved Asimov, Clarke, or Niven at all, I can pretty much guarantee you&#8217;ll enjoy McDevitt. And even if you didn&#8217;t there is so much <em>fun</em>&nbsp;in these series that I think it&#8217;ll be worth your time. Just because there are few explosions and gunfights doesn&#8217;t mean these stories aren&#8217;t exciting: McDevitt&#8217;s work will make the past&#8211;and the future&#8211;come alive.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/askolo-an-interesting-new-one-to-one-qa-site/">#Askolo: An interesting new one-to-one Q&A site</a></h1>
      <p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">I&#8217;ve been playing a bit this weekend with <a href="http://askolo.com/">Askolo</a>: a new variation on the question-answer site, where you can post anonymous questions to be answered by specific people rather than by the crowd at large. To quote their About page,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; font-size: small; color: #000000;">Askolo wants to organize Q&amp;A around thought leaders and experts. We&#8217;re creating a space where people can find not just one answer, but rather a site where you can share a diversity of opinions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">For the most part the site seems to be full of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> members at the moment, which is unsurprising: the startup is YC-funded, and they put up a pretty prominent <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3747238">launch post</a> on Friday.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">I&#8217;m still deciding what I think of &#8220;Q&amp;A around thought leaders&#8221;, but what the hell: I signed up and answered what looks like a standard new-user question: &#8220;What can people ask you about?&#8221;. My answer was simply,</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">High performance and scientific computing are most of what I&#8217;m up to right now. I also know a bit about fencing, roller derby (via my fiancee), materials science and physics.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">To my surprise, I actually got a bunch of questions on my page over the next day or so, all HPC-related so far. To take a look, check out <a href="http://askolo.com/ajdecon">my user page</a>. (All Q&amp;As are on a single user-page right now.) The questions so far are</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think of the AWS HPC clusters?</li>
<li>Does &#8220;bare-metal&#8221; basically mean a server without hypervisor?</li>
<li>How do you handle security? A lot of HPC tasks outside academia involve sensitive data or algorithms.</li>
<li>What do you think about reconfigurable logic (FPGAs) in HPC cluster environments?</li>
<li>What do you think of the next-generation NVIDIA GPUs for HPC?</li>
<li>Does Infiniband have a future?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you read my answers, the main thing you&#8217;ll probably learn is that I&#8217;m a wordy bastard. :-) &nbsp;But I hope that I&#8217;ve said something useful there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of the people I notice on HN have also ended up there, and answered at least a few questions which I thought were interesting. I&#8217;ll be more interested in the site if it manages to expand its user base, especially outside the Internet-startups crowd. But I&#8217;ve already learned a few things I didn&#8217;t know, so I&#8217;ll hang around there for at least a bit.</p>
<p>So to be self-interested: Go! Sign up! Ask and answer questions, and make the Internet a slightly more interesting place.</p>

      <p>Broadly defined, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> is a movement that advocates a close integration between the areas of software development, system administration and (to a lesser extent) quality assurance. It&#8217;s attracted a lot of attention lately in organizations which do software as a service and other webapp-y things, and as that&#8217;s where all the hot startups are these days. Applied to specific people, the &#8220;DevOps movement&#8221; seems to advocate either giving developers responsibilities traditionally allocated to sysadmins, or at least training the sysadmins to do software development (and, sometimes, unleashing them on the codebase).</p> <p /> <p>As far as I can tell the movement has developed, at least in part, in response to the growing usage of &#8220;Infrastructure as a Service&#8221; clouds for Internet startups and other Web properties. IaaS doesn&#8217;t remove sysadmin responsibilities completely, but it negates the hardware bits and makes the idea of &#8220;programmable infrastructure&#8221; much more attractive. A lot of great tools have come out of DevOps or associated companies: in particular, the <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> and <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> configuration management systems are incredibly interesting and potentially very useful in HPC.</p> <p /> <p>It&#8217;s easy to see why I&#8217;d be interested in the whole DevOps thing: while my current responsibilities at <a href="http://www.r-hpc.com/">R-HPC</a> are much more on the sysadmin side of things, the majority of my career in research labs leaves me closer to development, and I definitely try to keep one foot in the door on the development side. So as the whole DevOps movement has developed, I&#8217;ve been trying to think about how it applies to traditional high-performance computing environments, and also what it means for the growing use of &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; for HPC.</p> <p /> <p>On the one hand, it&#8217;s easy to say that the whole DevOps philosophy of integrating the sysadmin and development teams doesn&#8217;t apply very well to traditional sorts of HPC environments. Most of the biggest and most exciting HPC environments out there&#8211;the sort that appear near the top of the <a href="http://top500.org/">Top 500 list</a>&#8211;are academic environments in which the majority of the code is developed by scientists and engineers doing domain-specific research. Good luck doing DevOps there: most of the scientists have very little interest in the infrastructure they&#8217;re running on, making these environments much closer to &#8220;Platform as a Service&#8221; clouds like <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">AppEngine</a>. It&#8217;s &#8220;MPI as a Service&#8221;!</p> <p /> <p>On the other hand, there&#8217;s a strong argument that HPC has already embraced some of the core features of the DevOps movement. While there&#8217;s still a pretty clear organizational line between sysadmin and scientist at most HPC sites, there&#8217;s a lot more interaction than you typically associate with ops and dev teams in an enterprise. Most HPC sysadmins worth their salt can do some programming, and know more about the sorts of optimizations available on their systems than most of their users. The ops team at an HPC site spends a lot of time interacting with users and even helping to debug code and improve performance. (I know that this is certainly true at R-HPC: while a lot of people do show up with commercial applications, we spend a lot of time on performance optimizations and helping our customers with ancillary code and scripts.)</p> <p /> <p><a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/O/on-the-gripping-hand.html">On the gripping hand</a>&#8230; &#8220;HPC in the Cloud&#8221; is not going away any time soon. (Which, to give a disclaimer, I&#8217;m obviously counting on at R-HPC.) If I recall correctly, at HPC 360 <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/addisonsnell">Addison Snell</a> gave a talk which put the average size of a parallel job on an HPC cluster at about 32 cores. At that scale, it&#8217;s going to get easier and easier to run typical HPC jobs on &#8220;cloud providers&#8221; such as R-HPC or Amazon&#8217;s EC2. Most people don&#8217;t need a Top 500 system to do their work. And if you&#8217;re working in the cloud, it&#8217;s likely going to mean that you&#8217;ll be using the tools developed for it, such as Chef. So HPC will probably have to engage with the DevOps movement and their tools, and everyone is likely to learn something in that conversation.</p> <p /> <p>I don&#8217;t have any good conclusions, but it continues to be an exciting time for anyone interested in parallel computing, HPC, infrastructure automation, or the Cloud in general. There&#8217;s still a lot to be done, and it&#8217;ll be a lot of fun figuring out how it&#8217;s all going to work.</p>
