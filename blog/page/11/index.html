      <p>Only speculating here, but I&#8217;m starting to think that people&#8217;s online styles are heavily influenced by the styles of the online communities they&#8217;ve been involved in before&#8211;especially the first ones. &nbsp;There are obvious examples&#8211;for example, it&#8217;s always been easy to spot 4chan refugees&#8211;but it also seems to extend to less obnoxious communities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, I find it possible to recognize many fellow kuro5hin refugees, because that site encouraged a certain style of discourse which involved long and detailed comments, which were nevertheless modded down to hell if they seemed too pretentious. &nbsp;This isn&#8217;t necessarily a good style, I should note: it encouraged obnoxious Internet libertarians, and simultaneously celebrated intelligence and hated intellectualism. &nbsp;But I notice its marks in my own Internet behavior, years after kuro5hin fell apart and became a haven for trolls, because I was involved in kuro5hin during my formative Internet years. &nbsp;Metafilter users are similarly recognizable, albiet with a much lower incidence of Internet libertarians and a higher toleration for hipsters. &nbsp;And the Digg refugees who recently fled their sinking ship are now spreading their memes elsewhere.</p>
<p>A common lifecycle for an online community is to grow, develop, attract too many users to be sustainable, and then fall apart; the lucky ones retain enough of their core base to keep their personality for a small group. &nbsp;So most people will be involved in a series of communities, and pick up different influences.</p>
<p>For the curious, my own chain of communities looks something like this:</p>
<p>Slashdot -&gt; Kuro5hin -&gt; ScienceBlogs -&gt; PHD Comics Forums -&gt; Hacker News</p>

      <p>Any geek will tell you that their computer setup is a very personal thing. The combination of a person&#8217;s machine, operating system, choice of editor, and myriad configuration options can be important to a person&#8217;s workflow, and sometimes to their very peace of mind. These are Important Choices.</p> <p /> <p><a href="http://www.usesthis.com/">The Setup</a> is a fun if geeky blog which interviews prominent people and asks them about how they have their systems set up. It&#8217;s a lot of fun to follow, partly because it gives you different ideas about how to set up your own computer. And partly because it&#8217;s fun to find out that Matthew Mckeon refuses to let go of his zombie Thinkpad; that Keita Takahashi, the designer of Katamari Damacy, found it important to list the make and model of his refrigerator; and that Stephen Wolfram uses Mathematica for everything he can get away with.</p> <p /> <p>This got me thinking about my own setup, and how I&#8217;ve played with it and become comfortable with it. And since I&#8217;m bored and waiting for Leigh for dinner, I figured I&#8217;d write it all out. I can compare it with 6 months from now, and see what changes. We&#8217;ll pretend I&#8217;m important enough to do an interview at the Setup. :)</p> <p /> <p><b>Who are you, and what do you do?</b></p> <p /> <p>My name is Adam DeConinck. I&#8217;m currently a grad student in materials science, doing research on colloidal materials. In November I&#8217;ll be starting a job in high-performance computing at R Systems NA, Inc.</p> <p /> <p><b>What hardware are you using?</b></p> <p /> <p>My primary computer is a little Asus netbook, an EeePC 1005HAB. It&#8217;s tiny and underpowered but it&#8217;s probably as fast as my first laptop, and does the job pretty well. I like that it&#8217;s very portable, the small keyboard doesn&#8217;t bother me, and it&#8217;s a lot more solid than some larger laptops I&#8217;ve used. It dual-boots Ubuntu and Win7, which I&#8217;m sure Asus never intended.</p> <p /> <p>I also have an iPod Touch, a Dell desktop of indeterminate age which serves media files to my Xbox 360, and a bargain-basement Verizon phone I plan to replace at my earliest convenience. My work machine is a occasionally-used Dell laptop which the University owns, and sits on my desk. My new employers will also buy my a Dell laptop, but I hope to use that more.</p> <p /> <p><b>And what software?</b></p> <p /> <p>Most important is probably Dropbox, as it backs up my important files and syncs with the University laptop, as well as helping with several paper collaborations. My browser of choice is Google Chrome, which I like for its minimal chrome and good stability. I like that the &#8220;pin tab&#8221; function in Chrome, and Gmail, Twitter and Pandora generally all live in pins on the left-hand side of my tab bar.</p> <p /> <p>I use a wide variety of software for my research, but the most important are probably ImageJ for lightweight image processing, python for simple text processing, and Matlab for image analysis and data processing. I test on my laptop and then run on full datasets on our group servers. I also have a VPS which I use for personal server-based work.</p> <p /> <p>I generally live in Ubuntu when I can, though some of my research tools require Windows. I generally have issues managing screen real estate, but I recently hit on a solution for the netbook involving lots of virtual desktops. Compiz provides a nice &#8220;expose&#8221; view of all at once which gives a good overview, and then I can maximize all my windows without fear of annoying overlap or Alt-Tab hell.</p> <p /> <p>My editor is vim and I use mercurial for version control. That&#8217;s sufficient for taking sides in holy wars.</p> <p /> <p><b>What would be your dream setup?</b></p> <p /> <p>My favorite laptops are probably IBM Thinkpads, but I don&#8217;t insist on them. Honestly my major requirement for a laptop is that it not be ten pounds, and not feel like it&#8217;s going to break in my hands. The majority of my work has always been on a server or larger computer via ssh, so the particular hardware doesn&#8217;t matter much. </p>

      While I&#8217;m taking a break from coursework this semester to focus on <br />research, I really don&#8217;t want this to become a semester where I don&#8217;t <br />learn anything interesting outside my tiny project. I don&#8217;t want <br />homework deadlines, but I do want to keep my brain expanding. <p /> Usefully, I&#8217;ve just discovered a <a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=348ca38a-3a6d-4052-937d-cb017338d7b1">machine learning course</a> from Stanford which has all the lectures, videos, <br />etc. up on the web. This seems like something reasonable for me to <br />play with during some downtime, especially since machine learning and <br />statistics are things I&#8217;ve always been interested in. It also seems <br />like a good excuse to keep this blog revitalized. :) <p /> I&#8217;ll start on lecture 1, and as I go try to summarize the essential <br />features as I go. Watch this space.

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/google-reader/">Google Reader </a></h1>
      [[posterous-content:xeWmjOFgN1dbTr9K9s7c]]<p>As a lot of my friends know, I spend a ridiculous amount of time <br />reading RSS feeds in <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a>. I follow a grand total of something like 96 feeds, and I <br />usually wake up each day with something over 200 unread items, and <br />then another 100-200 in the evening. A lot of these are things like <br />BBC and NYTimes articles for which I only skim headlines, but I <br />probably read in depth a good 50-70 articles per day. <p /> Recently I&#8217;ve also been playing with the social and tracking tools <br />that GReader includes, which are becoming more and more useful to me. <br />Each article has a little &#8220;Share&#8221; button under it, and clicking this <br />adds the article to a feed which other users can see. It also tags <br />the article with a small comment feed and an optional area to leave a <br />note at the top, almost as if you had just blogged about the article. <p /> This gets published in GReader, as its own web page (mine is <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/ajdecon">here</a>), and as <br />an <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user%2F14044893685848644248%2Fstate%2Fcom.google%2Fbroadcast">Atom feed</a> which other people can subscribe to in any feed reader. You <br />can control how public or private this all is. This is a pretty <br />obvious targeting of Twitter, but I think it occupies its own niche as <br />Twitter does not easily connect with RSS on the article discovery <br />side. And Twitter is less about link sharing and more about <br />conversation anyway. <p /> The pool of people who auto-discover your feed through GReader <br />consists of your GChat contacts. This is useful, but it&#8217;d be better <br />if there were a better way of discovering new feeds, especially from <br />people you don&#8217;t already know and email. Google might be restricting <br />this through some kind of privacy setting, or I might just not have <br />found any good ways to find people to follow, but I&#8217;d love to be able <br />to (for example) follow top scientists&#8217; reading that they share from <br />journals&#8217; rss feeds, without knowing them personally. <p /> Another neat feature they&#8217;ve thrown in recently is Trends (under the <br />home link on the sidebar), which gives you a nice view of your reading <br />and sharing habits. I don&#8217;t know how useful that actually is, but <br />it&#8217;s fun to look at.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/turn-coat-book-11-of-the-dresden-files-jim-bu/">Turn Coat, Book 11 of the Dresden Files, by Jim Butcher </a></h1>
      <p>Last week I got my copy of Turn Coat, book 11 of Jim Butcher&#8217;s Dresden <br />Files series. For the uninitiated, the Dresden Files follows the <br />adventures of Harry Dresden, the only wizard in Chicago&#8217;s Yellow <br />Pages. Starting out mostly as a PI with some magical abilities, in <br />recent books Harry&#8217;s adventures have shaded into more standard <br />urban-fantasy stories of magic, mystery and conspiracy. Especially <br />conspiracy, as Harry and others have come to the conclusion that there <br />must be a traitor in the ranks of the White Council, the governing <br />body of wizardry in this world. <br />&nbsp;<br />The book opens immediately with Harry answering his front door to find <br />Morgan, a long-time antagonist and Warden of the White Council who <br />thinks of Harry as a dangerous threat, asking for sanctuary from the <br />Council himself on a charge of murder. Harry, being a glutton for <br />punishment, of course allows him inside and decides that Morgan is <br />innocent. This sets off a chain of chaotic events in which everyone <br />is looking for Morgan, Harry is attempting to prove his innocence and <br />the involvement of the real traitor, and various friends and denizens <br />of Chicago are caught in the middle. <br />&nbsp;<br />Without giving away too many details, it&#8217;s debatable whether the end <br />of this novel can really be called a victory. Harry technically <br />&#8220;wins&#8221; as usual, but he loses a lot in the process, and damages a <br />number of relationships and alliances along the way. He doesn&#8217;t seem <br />to have gained much in the process, unlike previous books where he has <br />met new allies or gained new knowledge. <br />&nbsp;<br />Jim Butcher has talked about how the Dresden files will be a long <br />series with an &#8220;apocalyptic trilogy&#8221; at the end, and it&#8217;s apparent <br />that this might be the turning point at which things start to get a <br />lot darker.  As a story I felt this was a stronger installment than <br />the last novel, &#8220;Small Favor&#8221;, which didn&#8217;t feel as tight or focused <br />to me as this latest one. At the same time I&#8217;m not sure how much I&#8217;m <br />looking forward to the next Dresden Files novel: this series has <br />always had its fair share of darkness but were lightened by Harry&#8217;s <br />humor and relationships with his friends. As things get darker in <br />this world and alliances become strained, it&#8217;s hard to see how much <br />light will be present as the series goes on&#8230; which may forward the <br />plot, but also lose a large part of why the series was so enjoyable in <br />the first place.</p>
