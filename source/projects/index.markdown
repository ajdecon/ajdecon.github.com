A few things I enjoyed or am proud of having worked on (that I can 
actually show in public!):

* [Warewulf](http://warewulf.lbl.gov): a system for provisioning and managing 
Linux systems, well-optimized for working with HPC clusters, and developed
out of Berkeley Labs. I've done a little
work on the stateful provisioning, IPMI and user interface, and mostly done a
lot of bugfixing as I run into problems. One of my primary tools as an HPC admin.

* [imagej_morphology](https://github.com/ajdecon/imagej_morphology): A library
based on the popular [ImageJ](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) image processing 
program for carrying out morphological operations, and some associated plugins
for ImageJ itself.

* ["Genotyping by Alkaline Dehybridization Using Graphically Encoded 
Particles"](http://colloids.matse.illinois.edu/articles/zhang_ChemEurJ.pdf): This 
project, led by Huaibin Zhang, demonstrated a cool way to do DNA discrimination
using pH as a driving force rather than heat, and encapsulated it in a neat
polymer-particle and microfluidic device. I was involved in the fabrication
of the encoded microparticles, and in the image processing of the microscopy
images and some of the subsequent analysis. The 
[supplementary information](http://www.ajdecon.org/pubfiles/Zhang-et-al_Supplementary_Information.pdf)
on this paper is worth reading if you enjoy the analysis portion.

* [M.S. thesis](https://github.com/ajdecon/ms_thesis): "Fabrication, dynamics and 
self-assembly of anisotropic colloidal particles." Details my work on the fabrication
of "patchy" microparticles with non-spherical geometry and non-uniform composition, 
and some work on measuring and analysing their interaction at low concentration.
Really only of interest if you enjoy soft matter materials science, but analyzing
the microscopy data was also
a good "practical" application of morphological image processing.

Also, see a list of my [publications](/pubs).
