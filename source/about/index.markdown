Hi, my name is Adam DeConinck.

I am a systems administratior
and sometime software developer,
mostly focussed on building, managing, and optimizing
high-performance computing systems used for science and engineering.
(Which is a long-winded way of saying, I do sysadmin on
supercomputers!)

I am currently located in Santa Fe, NM, USA.

My professional interests also include distributed systems,
automation of system administration in both the cloud
and the datacenter, and making scientific computing systems easier to
set up and use for working scientists. In the past I've done research
in physics and materials science, mostly oriented towards microfluidics
and "soft materials" systems.

(See my [LinkedIn page](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ajdecon) for a summary
of some of what I've worked on in the past.)

Apart from work, 
I'm also a huge geek: I spend an inordinate amount of time reading science
fiction, playing board games, and hanging out with my equally nerdy wife
[Leigh](http://about.me/lfeather). I fence epee, play the trumpet, and spend
far too much time on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/ajdecon).

If any of the above sounds interesting, feel free to give me a shout.
I love meeting new people and talking about interesting things.
