Here's a picture of a cat.

More seriously: I haven't had much time or energy to devote to writing longer-form
content for this blog lately, which is really what it's good for. I've been
posting much more frequently to
[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/ajdecon) and 
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/116247823819167414235/posts). It's
(usually) shorter, and a lot of it is interesting -- especially if you're 
here for the HPC and not the cat posts. :)

I've also been sharing code more frequently on [Github](http://www.github.com/ajdecon) 
lately, mostly small tools and scripts to make life easier when doing sysadmin
on a cluster.
