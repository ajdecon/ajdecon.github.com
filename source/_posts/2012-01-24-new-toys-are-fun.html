<p>As of about a month ago <a href="http://www.r-hpc.com/" title="R-HPC">at work</a>, we got a shiny new cluster running Intel's new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bridge">Sandy Bridge</a> <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/52276">processors</a>. We immediately started running Windows HPC on them, which made me sad in way, but what the user needs for the application is right by definition. &nbsp;We got some nice improvements even with code that couldn't be re-compiled for the new optimizations available, but we finally got to start cutting a few of them over to Linux today. I can't wait to start running benchmarks...</p>
