<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">I've been playing a bit this weekend with <a href="http://askolo.com/">Askolo</a>: a new variation on the question-answer site, where you can post anonymous questions to be answered by specific people rather than by the crowd at large. To quote their About page,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; font-size: small; color: #000000;">Askolo wants to organize Q&amp;A around thought leaders and experts. We're creating a space where people can find not just one answer, but rather a site where you can share a diversity of opinions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">For the most part the site seems to be full of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> members at the moment, which is unsurprising: the startup is YC-funded, and they put up a pretty prominent <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3747238">launch post</a> on Friday.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">I'm still deciding what I think of "Q&amp;A around thought leaders", but what the hell: I signed up and answered what looks like a standard new-user question: "What can people ask you about?". My answer was simply,</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">High performance and scientific computing are most of what I'm up to right now. I also know a bit about fencing, roller derby (via my fiancee), materials science and physics.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">To my surprise, I actually got a bunch of questions on my page over the next day or so, all HPC-related so far. To take a look, check out <a href="http://askolo.com/ajdecon">my user page</a>. (All Q&amp;As are on a single user-page right now.) The questions so far are</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think of the AWS HPC clusters?</li>
<li>Does "bare-metal" basically mean a server without hypervisor?</li>
<li>How do you handle security? A lot of HPC tasks outside academia involve sensitive data or algorithms.</li>
<li>What do you think about reconfigurable logic (FPGAs) in HPC cluster environments?</li>
<li>What do you think of the next-generation NVIDIA GPUs for HPC?</li>
<li>Does Infiniband have a future?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you read my answers, the main thing you'll probably learn is that I'm a wordy bastard. :-) &nbsp;But I hope that I've said something useful there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of the people I notice on HN have also ended up there, and answered at least a few questions which I thought were interesting. I'll be more interested in the site if it manages to expand its user base, especially outside the Internet-startups crowd. But I've already learned a few things I didn't know, so I'll hang around there for at least a bit.</p>
<p>So to be self-interested: Go! Sign up! Ask and answer questions, and make the Internet a slightly more interesting place.</p>
