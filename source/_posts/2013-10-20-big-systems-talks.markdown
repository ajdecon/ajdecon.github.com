Lately I've been watching a lot of recorded conference talks on YouTube,
mostly about HPC, distributed systems or DevOps for big deployments.
Some of these are a lot of fun and extremely interesting, but I don't 
really want to clutter this blog with tons of YouTube embeds. So I've 
created a Tumblr called [Big Systems Talks](http://bigsystemstalks.tumblr.com)
where I can share them.

If you're interested in these topics, check it out. Right now most of
the posts are from the Ricon East 2013 conference, which recently uploaded
a ton of awesome talks to YouTube.
