In the past few hours, I have...

* Made casual jokes with a friend thousands of miles away, at virtually
no expense.

* Worked on a class I'm taking, for free, from a university at a 
similar distance.

* Watched a short video, obscure and decades old, on a whim.

* Exchanged useful technical information with a stranger who may live
on the other side of the world, or next door.

* Searched virtually all the world's information for one trivial 
fact to make my life slightly easier.

* Used a computer, hundreds of times more powerful than those used to
run the moon mission or simulate the atomic bomb, just to look at cute
pictures of cats.

And I did all of this while sitting outside, at a bar, while enjoying
a tasty beer which was imported at low expense from the other side 
of the world.

Fifty years ago, most of these ideas would have been ludicrous. A hundred
years ago, they would have been *unimaginable*.

We take all of this for granted. It's worth recognizing, every once in a 
while, that despite all our problems, we live in an age of wonders.
