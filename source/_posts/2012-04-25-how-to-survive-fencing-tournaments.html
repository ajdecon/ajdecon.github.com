<p>A few years back, when I was helping run the tiny <a href="http://www.involvement.mtu.edu/organization/fencing-club">fencing club</a> at Michigan Tech, I wrote up a short primer on fencing tournaments aimed at the beginning fencer. I lost track of it for a while, but ran across it on an old backup disk recently, and it still looks decently useful for attending your first fencing tournament. I've attached the document to this post; consider it to be under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons BY-SA license</a>.</p>
<p>If you're a beginning fencer, this should give you a decent idea of what a tournament will look like, but check in with your coach! Your club may do things differently. If you're a coach, please feel free to steal anything you like from this document, and I'd love to know if you find it useful.</p>
