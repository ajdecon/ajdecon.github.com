  <h1>Hi, I'm Adam.</h1>

<br/><br/>
<p>I'm an engineer who does system administration and tool development
for high-performance 
computing clusters (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer">"supercomputers"</a>).
My major interest is in scientific computing, and how HPC and cloud computing 
can enable better capabilities for science (i.e., better performance),
make it easier to accomplish computing goals (i.e, better tools), and
enable better access to HPC resources for scientists working at small 
scales (cloud!). I'm also interested in how DevOps practices can be applied
to HPC clusters and "general-use" computing facilities.</p>
<p>In addition to all the work stuff, I am a geek who reads a lot of 
science fiction, plays a lot of board games, and 
watches <a href="http://svrollergirls.com/">roller derby</a> when my 
lovely wife <a href="http://about.me/lfeather">Leigh</a> is playing.</p>
<p><strong>You can find me online at...</strong></p>
