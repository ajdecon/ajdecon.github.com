<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Adam.</h1>

<div style="font-size: 160%; line-height: 120%">
<br/>
<p>I build and manage high-performance computing clusters, and write software
to help automate those tasks. I'm strongly interested in parallel and 
scientific computing, and in making parallel computing more accessible for working
researchers.</p>
<p>I currently work at <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/">NVIDIA</a>, where I work on 
problems related to GPUs for cluster computing and maintain internal HPC infrastructure.
</p>
<p>In the past I've done <a href="http://blog.ajdecon.org/pubs/">academic
research</a> in physics and materials science, frequently with
a computational component.</p>

<p>I also fence, play board games, play the trumpet, entertain our cats, and cheer wildly at my 
wife <a href="http://about.me/lfeather">Leigh's</a> 
roller derby bouts. All of these things will make an appearance from time to time on 
<a href="/blog">the blog.</a></p>
