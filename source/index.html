<p>I build and maintain high-performance computing clusters, and 
sometimes write software for them. I currently work at <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/">NVIDIA</a>, where I work on 
problems related to GPUs for HPC and maintain internal HPC infrastructure. I've also worked at
<a href="http://www.r-hpc.com/">R Systems</a>, building and automating clusters for HPC as a Service. In 
the past I’ve done research in physics and materials science.</p>

<p>I also fence, play board games, play the trumpet, entertain our cats, and cheer wildly at my 
wife <a href="http://about.me/lfeather">Leigh's</a> 
roller derby bouts. All of these things will make an appearance from time to time on 
<a href="/blog">this blog.</a></p>
