<p><strong>Adam DeConinck builds HPC clusters.</strong> He also 
reads a ridiculous amount of science fiction, plays board games,
fences, plays the trumpet, and occasionally writes on this blog.
He lives in California with his wife <a href="http://http://about.me/lfeather">Leigh</a>
and their two cute-but-annoying cats.
