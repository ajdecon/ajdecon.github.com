      <b>Net result: Pool record 0-5, seeded 17/18, first DE 15-10, second <br />DE 7-15.</b> <p />&nbsp;Yesterday was the 2009 Dufour Epee Tournament at <a href="http://www.thepointfencingclub.com/">the Point</a>. The <br />tournament&#8217;s named after Marie France Dufour, a Canadian olympian who <br />was one of the original coaches at the club, and is held every year in <br />her honor. She didn&#8217;t make it down from Canada this year, but <br />apparently she&#8217;s done so in past years. <p />&nbsp;At three months and counting since I had gotten back into fencing, I <br />was feeling pretty decent about this tournament. I had done better <br />than I had expected in the last epee tourney a month or so ago, ending <br />up seeded towards the middle and only losing 15-14 in my second DE to <br />someone I expected to grind me to dust. This time I expected to do a <br />bit better, at least in pools. <p />&nbsp;This, of course, did not happen. <p />&nbsp;I was in a much tougher pool than the previous tourney: three D/E <br />fencers, including my coach, and the other two U&#8217;s being both <br />left-handed, which I still don&#8217;t know how to deal with very well. I <br />lost all my bouts, but mostly by respectably small margins. I only <br />lost one bout 0-5, which was frankly disastrous in every way: I had <br />unexpected equipment problems with both my primary and backup blades, <br />resulting in a red card and a point down before the bout had even <br />started, and having to fence with an unfamiliar blade my coach had <br />provided. I was angry and frustrated before the bout even started, <br />and my opponent (the pool&#8217;s D) took me down pretty easily. <p />&nbsp;So I was seeded 17/18, but came into a bit of luck in that my first <br />elimination bout was against seed 16. After a shaky start&#8211;the guy <br />had a really good guard against direct arm attacks, which is what I <br />like to use&#8211;I managed to take control and won 15-10, where most of <br />his touches took advantage of the fact that I&#8217;m still dropping and <br />exposing my upper arm too much. <p />&nbsp;I lost my second elimination bout, 7-15, to DP, another fencer from my <br />club. This felt rather less bad, DP being an extremely strong epeeist <br />and seed 1 in this tournament; in fact, this may have beem my best <br />result against him to date. I got in a couple of nice hand and wrist <br />touches, and finished feeling like I hadn&#8217;t been completely shut out, <br />which was my main goal for that bout. I may ask DP to work with me on <br />a few things later, as some of his touches were not things I expected. <p />&nbsp;I finished the tournament frustrated, though, until my coach talked me <br />down. He told me I had improved since the last tourney&#8211;hard to <br />believe!&#8211;and had simply been up against a tougher field. I&#8217;m still <br />not sure how much I believe that in my back-brain, but it at least had <br />the effect of getting me to look at my <i>fencing</i> rather than my <br />results, and note exactly what I had to work on and what I did right. <p />&nbsp;D and M also arrived later to take over the club for the first <br />practice of the Parkland Fencing Club, a club they&#8217;re starting at <br />their community college. I stuck around and helped out teaching the <br />complete newbies, as D and M are both yet to finish their beginners&#8217; <br />class but still hugely enthusiastic about fencing and making the PFC a <br />reality. This honestly helped me cheer up and relax for the rest of <br />the evening: working on fencing basics is always helpful, and D and M <br />are simply fun people to be around which also honestly helped. <p />&nbsp;Next two tournaments are the Friday Night Foil Fight on April 17 <br />(which should be fun even though I suck at foil) and a tourney in <br />Indianapolis on May 2 where I plan to fence epee, and maybe foil if I <br />feel like being ridiculous. I can spend the next few weeks working on <br />problems I noticed from this tourney, mainly involving distance <br />control and killing bad habits.
